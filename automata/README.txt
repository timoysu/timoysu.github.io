To open the RegEx to NFA/DFA Converter and FA Generator Application, use the latest web browser,
preferably Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

Also, for best experience, a minimum screen resolution of 1280 x 768 and above is highly recommended.

State Legend:
	State with ">" : Start state (Mint green if not final)
	Purple state   : Nonfinal state
	Magenta state  : Final State
	Gray state     : Dead State

Due to the browser's limited processing power, the application cannot efficiently perform tasks that involve
a very large number of states (e.g. converting an NFA with more than 110 or so states into DFA, etc.). However,
operations performed on a reasonable number of states is very much possible.

Enjoy!
